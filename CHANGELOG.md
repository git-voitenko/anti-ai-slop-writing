# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The version in
`SKILL.md`, `package.json` and this file must agree; `npm run lint:skill` fails
if they drift.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- CONTRIBUTING: a section on how a pull request lands (required checks
  `verify` and `agent-review`, merge commits only).

### Changed

- The repository now lives at `git-voitenko/anti-ai-slop-writing`: install with
  `npm install git-voitenko/anti-ai-slop-writing` or run
  `npx github:git-voitenko/anti-ai-slop-writing`. The previous owner address
  still works through the GitHub redirect.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- Rebuilt the skill around a fast default pass. A routine task now loads
  `SKILL.md` and one short language module instead of the core craft guide,
  banned list and rewrite catalog on every invocation.
- Replaced absolute punctuation, sentence-length and list rules with contextual
  checks. A pattern now matters when it is empty, repeated, out of register or
  clustered with other generic habits.
- Added explicit generate, rewrite, audit, embedded and file behavior while
  keeping the default output to the finished prose only.
- Made author voice and source preservation the first constraints. The skill
  no longer invents anecdotes, opinions, slang, roughness or facts to perform a
  stock "human" voice.
- Reframed detector output as review evidence rather than proof of authorship.
  The full craft audit is now an optional module for long-form and explicit
  audit work.

### Fixed

- Documentation pointed at `npx aislop`, which resolves to an unrelated package
  on npm. Install and run instructions now use the repository.
- Credits attributed the English list partly to Buffer's 52M-post analysis; that
  study measures social media engagement, not AI writing markers. Replaced with
  the Carnegie Mellon 2025 study, linked.
- Corrected the word count in the README demo, and the test count.
- Adjective stems were cut by one letter, so «даний» never matched «даного».
  They now lose the whole ending.
- «данные» and «дані» were flagged as the канцелярит «даний»/«данный». Both mean
  data; stemming cannot separate them, so the forms are listed as exceptions.

- `references/en/banned.md` carried the same wrong citation; replaced there too,
  with the authors named.

### Changed

- Placeholder slots per banned entry are capped, bounding regex matching cost.
- House style now calls for the en dash (–) instead of the em dash (—) in every
  language, including for the required grammatical тире in Russian and
  Ukrainian: same role, easier to type. Updated in `SKILL.md`, the three
  `rules.md` modules, and the surrounding documentation. The `em-dash` and
  `rhetorical-dash` detector rules already counted either glyph, so no code
  changed; the two banned-phrase citations that the detector parses literally
  (`references/{ru,uk,en}/banned.md`) keep the em dash, since they must still
  match that construction wherever it shows up in someone else's draft.
  Official, government, and legal-register documents are exempt from this
  switch, same as the existing канцелярит exception: they keep the
  traditional em dash.

### Added

- `validate-skill.js` now checks the documentation against the files it
  describes: the README counts table against the parsed lists, every relative
  link in README, CONTRIBUTING and docs, and any instruction to install `aislop`
  from npm.
- A Ukrainian before/after pair in the README, written with the skill itself.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-11

First public release. The skill had been in private use before this; the version
number continues that history rather than restarting at 1.0.0.

### Added

- `SKILL.md` — the writing directive: structural rules, punctuation budgets, the
  no-invented-facts rule, voice calibration, and the draft → audit → final loop.
- `references/core/craft.md` — second-order craft rules that apply to every
  language, plus the revision discipline that keeps the other rules from
  hollowing out a draft.
- `references/{en,ru,uk}/` — three modules per language: `rules.md` (grammar-level
  tells that override the general rules), `banned.md` (vocabulary, phrases,
  openers), `patterns.md` (before/after pairs and a public-domain human
  exemplar).
- `detector/` — a zero-dependency linter that parses the same `banned.md` files
  the model reads, so the word lists have one home. Ships as the `aislop` CLI and
  a Node API.
- Structural rules the word lists cannot express: uniform sentence length, flat
  rhythm, parataxis, groups of three, credential openers, verbal-noun chains.
- Language-aware dash handling: the em dash is rationed in English, while
  grammatical тире stays free in Russian and Ukrainian and only rhetorical
  pauses count against the budget.
- `scripts/validate-skill.js` — frontmatter, description length, link
  resolution, and version agreement.
- `scripts/self-scan.js` — runs the detector over this repository's own
  documentation and writes `PROOF.md`; CI enforces the recorded budget.
- Test fixtures in both directions: slop the detector must catch, and ordinary
  human writing it must leave alone.
